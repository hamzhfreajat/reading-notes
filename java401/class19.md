## Difference between pure and impure functional programming
The exact difference between pure and impure functional programming is a matter of controversy

## Properties of purely functional programming
### Strict versus non-strict evaluation
### Parallel computing
### Data structures

## Purely functional language
A purely functional language is a language which only admits purely functional programming. Purely functional programs can however be written in languages which are not purely functional.
