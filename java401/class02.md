## A Guide to Java Loops
### Loops
looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.

### Types of loops : 

- Simple for loop
- Enhanced for-each loop
- While loop
- Do-While loop

### For Loop

A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

### While Loop

The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true


### Do-While Loop

The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
