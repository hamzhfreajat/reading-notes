# OO Design
## Don't repeat yourself
Don't repeat yourself (DRY) is a definition aimed  to avoid redundancy and reduce your code to become a good developer `"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"`

## Rule of three
Rule of three is about avoid duplication : ` It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure`.
Duplication bad practice and it makes the code harder to maintain.

## You aren't gonna need it
You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI) is talk about a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary .

## Minimum viable product 
Minimum viable product (MVP) void lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work by talk feedback from customer The MVP is analogous to experimentation in the scientific method applied in the context of validating business hypotheses. It is utilized so that prospective entrepreneurs would know whether a given business idea would actually be viable and profitable by testing the assumptions behind a product .

This strategy targets avoiding building products that customers do not want and seek to maximize information about the customer with the least money spent.
