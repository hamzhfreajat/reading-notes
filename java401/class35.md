# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Directed vs Undirected
### Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

### Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed , unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

### Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

### Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

### Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

### Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

### Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles
